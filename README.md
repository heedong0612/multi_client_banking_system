# multi_client_banking_system
Multi-client Banking System program in C++


A firm contains clients and a client contains 10 accounts of different bank types as default.
The firm is built based on a text file that contains the information of the clients and their accounts.

A client can request transactions such as deposits, withdraws, transfers, or loans among his/her accounts or with those of others. The transaction requests are formatted and written in a text file.


The program only proceeds with the valid transactions (got enough funds?) and informs the user after denying any transaction. At the end of execution, the program displays a report of valid transactions, denied requests, and all clients' before and after balances.
